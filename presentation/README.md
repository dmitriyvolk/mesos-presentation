Deployment with Mesos
=====================
Practical introduction to Mesos frameworks.

This is the source code for the presentation on Apache Mesos and its frameworks, written using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

To start, either open `index.html` in your browser, or run `grunt serve` from the presentation directory, then point your browser to `http://localhost:8000`. Before running for the first time make sure you have all the dependencies installed:

```shell
  $ npm install
  $ bower install
  $ grunt serve
```
